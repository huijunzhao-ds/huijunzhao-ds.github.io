I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/) AI Center of Excellence. My resume is downloadable [here](/resume.pdf).

I have a math PhD from [Northeastern University](https://cos.northeastern.edu/mathematics-3/), supervised by [Prof. Losev](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/index.html). My research interest was Representation theory and Algebraic Geometry. I graduated in July 2018, with a thesis named *Representations of Cyclotomic Rational Cherednik Algebras with Aspherical Parameters* ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06724) on arXiv).

During the last year in my PhD, I started learning data science and machine learning through online resources. After joining Fidelity AI CoE, since the company has enterprise accounts on several platforms including Coursera, Udemy and LinkedIn Learning, I have been learning a lot of skills on __deep learning and software development__, and writing code to practice those skills. The progress, although slow, is recorded [here](/projects.html/).

Last but not least, I'm the Mom of an adorable baby, [Robin](/robin.jpg/).
