![](/data/photo.jpg)

I have a math PhD from [Northeastern University](https://cos.northeastern.edu/mathematics-3/), supervised by [Prof. Losev](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/index.html). My research interest was Representation theory and Algebraic Geometry. I graduated in July 2018, with the thesis *Representations of Cyclotomic Rational Cherednik Algebras with Aspherical Parameters* ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06724) on arXiv).

In my spare time, I have been learning a lot of skills on __deep learning and software development__ through [online resources](/resources.html/), and working on [side projects](/projects.html/) to practice those skills.

At Fidelity, I mainly work on NLP algorithms to support financial advisors and customer service groups to better understand our customers. Meanwhile, I am also exposed to projects leveraging regression, computer vision, and reinforcement learning.  

Last but not least, I'm the Mom of an adorable baby, [Robin](/data/robin.jpg).
