I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/). My resume is downloadable [here](/resume.pdf).

I have a math PhD degree from [Northeastern University](https://cos.northeastern.edu/mathematics-3/), supervised by [Prof. Losev](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/index.html). My research interest was Representation theory and Algebraic Geometry. I graduated in July 2018, with my thesis: [Representations of Cyclotomic Rational Cherednik Algebras with Aspherical Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06724).

During the last year of my PhD, I started learning data science and machine learning through online resources.
