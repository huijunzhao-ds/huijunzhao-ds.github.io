# Huijun Zhao
I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/).

I was a PhD student in [Math Department](https://cos.northeastern.edu/mathematics-3/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Losev](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/index.html). My research interest was Representation theory and Algebraic Geometry. (Thesis: [Representations of Cyclotomic Rational Cherednik Algebras with Aspherical Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06724)).
