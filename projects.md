## Machine Learning Projects
Side projects I am working on or plan to work on. Contact me if you are interest to collaborate or have any comment. 

### Book Recommender
I'm sort of addicted to reading. Recently I just started using Goodreads to record books I read and to find new ones. At the same time, I'm building a book recommender to compare the recommendations it gives with those Goodreads does. The result will be fun. All data I use come from [here](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k).

The GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/huijunzhao-ds/book-recommender). Currently we are still processing the data and building the initial model. More doc and code to come soon.

### Image Style Transfer App
We are currently working on a deep learning model to generate a new image combining given content image and style image. And we will deploy the model to both a web application and a cross-platform (Android and iOS) mobile application.

The GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/huijunzhao-ds/style-transfer). Currently we have an initial implementation of the model, which takes really long time to run. We will try new and more efficient methods. More doc and code to come soon.

## Math Educational Website 
Once I was in math academia, and I felt sort of isolated by the outside world when people asked "What is your research about?". Although for most of the time, people were just trying to start some casual conversations, it is true that people do not know much about advanced math. 

Then I stepped outside math academia, and I found that, even though people in computer or electronic engineering, data science, deep learning are supposed to be experts in math, they are only in the commonly used techniques, not in the underlying theories. 

While I talk to more and more people eager to learn about machine learning, data science, AI, I see math is often one of the largest obstacle for them.

I hope to leverage my learning and teaching experience to build a website that show math in an efficient and interesting way. This will take long. But let me try every effort to make the outcome helpful for my friends, and my kid (who is just half a year old now. Thanks to him for giving me sufficient time). The website will include calculus, linear algebra, group theory, basic topology, and maybe more.

## Online Courses
Online courses I have completed and highly recommand

### Advanced Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera
- Math and coding intensive, but really helpful.
- Resources: [Course Link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml), [Assignment Solutions](https://github.com/huijunzhao-ds/advanced-machine-learning).
