## AI Projects
Side projects I work on

### Image Style Transfer App
I'm currently working on a deep learning model to generate a new image combining given content image and style image. And I will deploy the model to both a web application and a cross-platform (Android and iOS) mobile application.

The GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/huijunzhao-ds/style-transfer). More doc and code to come soon.
